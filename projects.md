The Kinetic Table was inspired and based off of the tables made by [Sisyphus Industries](https://sisyphus-industries.com/).
This was a personal project in order to practice prototyping methods and make use of topics learned from classes. This project
took approximately two months to complete and I intend to continue programming new designs. Files and CAD designs for the project
can be found under my personal [GrabCAD profile.](https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/projects/gc65KVhT07diAkviDsxtTxvUX19gEE6tuySJVHUeOcgKg-#/home)

Limbo was a school project for Carnegie Mellon's introductory programming course 15-112. This was a solo project which I had approximately
3 weeks to complete. The code for this project can be found in my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/remyfrank01/LimboGame). The aesthetic for the game was inspired by the popular indie
game of a similar name, Limbo, as well as Hollow Knight (two games whose artwork I very much admire).

#### Sketchy Etchy

The Sketchy Etchy was my first attempt at an XY plotter type build. The requirement for this project was to construct a handicap friendly device
that a young boy would want. The Sketchy Etchy was intended to be a whimsical, joystick controlled version of the Etch A Sketch.
