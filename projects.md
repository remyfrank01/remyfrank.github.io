The Jigsorter was my Capstone project for my final semester at Carnegie Mellon University for the class,
Electromechanical Systems Design. As the software lead for the project, I was responsible for developing the
following: puzzle piece shape identification algorithm, puzzle piece color classification algorithm, the auto
image capture program, and the integration between the motor controll board (Arduino) used for piece dispensing
and the main software board (Raspberry Pi). The code for this project is hosted in the [24-671-Team-Jigsorter](https://github.com/KenJ20/24-671-Team-Jigsorter/tree/main)
Github repo.

#### "Remy" Tower

The above sheet metal storage system was a side design project while working at JLG Industries, Inc. I was solely responsible
for the design, FEA and stress analysis, and materials management for the project which was used to optimize the use of space 
for sheet metal (aluminum) storage. In order to make the system "smarter" and easier to use for the forklift drivers, I 
conceptualized and programmed LIDAR sensors to read the elevation of the sheet metal pallet and to light a corresponding LED 
strip to indicate to the driver whether or not they were at a proper height.

#### Kinetic Table

The Kinetic Table was inspired and based off of the tables made by [Sisyphus Industries](https://sisyphus-industries.com/).
This was a personal project in order to practice prototyping methods and make use of topics learned from classes. This project
took approximately two months to complete and I intend to continue programming new designs. Files and CAD designs for the project
can be found under my personal [GrabCAD profile.](https://workbench.grabcad.com/workbench/projects/gc65KVhT07diAkviDsxtTxvUX19gEE6tuySJVHUeOcgKg-#/home)

#### Limbo - A Side Scrolling 8 Bit Game

Limbo was a school project for Carnegie Mellon's introductory programming course 15-112. This was a solo project which I had approximately
3 weeks to complete. The code for this project can be found in my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/remyfrank01/LimboGame). The aesthetic for the game was inspired by the popular indie
game of a similar name, Limbo, as well as Hollow Knight (two games whose artwork I very much admire).

#### Sketchy Etchy

The Sketchy Etchy was my first attempt at an XY plotter type build. The requirement for this project was to construct a handicap friendly device
that a young boy would want. The Sketchy Etchy was intended to be a whimsical, joystick controlled version of the Etch A Sketch.
