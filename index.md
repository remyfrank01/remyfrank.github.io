The Kinetic Table was inspired and based off of the tables made by [Sisyphus Industries](https://sisyphus-industries.com/).
This was a personal project in order to practice prototyping methods and make use of topics learned from classes. This project
took approximately two months to complete and I intend to continue programming new designs. Access the projects tab to view the 
CAD files for the project.

Limbo was a school project for Carnegie Mellon's introductory programming course 15-112. This was a solo project which I had approximately
3 weeks to complete. The code for this project can be found in my GitHub repositories. The aesthetic for the game was inspired the popular indie
game of a similar name, Limbo, as well as Hollow Knight (two games whose artwork I very much admire).
